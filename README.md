## 📖 About
This project is a modern, single-page portfolio designed to showcase my profile as a **Multiplatform Developer** specializing in **Big Data & AI**.

### Design Philosophy
1.  **Performance First** → Powered by **Next.js 14 (App Router)** and React Server Components for optimal loading times.
2.  **Visual Storytelling** → Using **Framer Motion** to create meaningful micro-interactions (magnetic cursors, scroll reveals) that guide the user.
3.  **Responsive Engineering** → A fluid layout that adapts efficiently from mobile touchscreens to wide desktop monitors using **Tailwind CSS**.
4.  **Identity** → A custom color palette (Sage/Lime/Dark) that reflects my personal brand: distinct, organic, and technical.

## 🚀 Features to highlight
- 🎨 **Custom Design System:** Built with Tailwind CSS variables and utility classes for consistent theming.
- ⚡ **Interactive Hero Section:** Features a background tracing effect and dynamic text animations.
- 🖱️ **Custom Cursor:** A magnetic cursor component that reacts to interactive elements (hidden on mobile for UX best practices).
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture:** Clean code structure separating UI components from business logic.
